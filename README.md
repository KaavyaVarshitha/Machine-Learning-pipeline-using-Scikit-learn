# Machine-Learning-pipeline-using-Scikit-learn

This project showcases a complete machine learning pipeline implemented using Scikit-Learn. It involves steps for data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation. The pipeline structure ensures a seamless and modular approach to machine learning, making it easy to apply to various datasets.

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning pipeline to automate the workflow of training and evaluating a model on a dataset. The pipeline is built with Scikit-Learn, covering the essential steps:

- **Data preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features.
- **Model Selection and Training:** Selecting a suitable algorithm and training it on preprocessed data.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing model performance through grid search or random search.
- **Evaluation:** Assessing the model using appropriate metrics and visualizations.

 ### Features

-  **End-to-End Pipeline:** From raw data to model evaluation, the pipeline covers all essential steps.
-  **Flexible Model Selection:** Easily switch between algorithms within the pipeline.
-  **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Integrated with Scikit-Learnâ€™s tuning capabilities for improved performance.
-  **Metrics and Evaluation:** Supports multiple evaluation metrics based on the task.
